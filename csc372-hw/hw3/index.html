        <p>Just finished class but you're hungry? No worries! We got plenty of food to sell to you on campus. 
            It's far more convenient than walking all the way back to the parking deck and then driving to a restaurant. You got hungry stomachs and we have the solution.
            Come eat at our dining hall where we have plenty of delicious options for you to choose from. It only takes a few steps from class to get here.
